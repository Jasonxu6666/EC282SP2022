## Course description 


This course aims to introduce 21st century econometric analysis to business students. It provides tools to infer meaningful information from data using descriptive and regression analyses. Causal inference and study design will be at the center of the econometrics analysis class.  

At the end of the semester, I expect you to be familiar with **R** and **RStudio** interface, basic data manipulation, obtaining and interpreting sample statistics, conduct meaningful regression analysis and prediction. Importantly, I expect you to have a clear understanding of the distinction between correlation and causation, and in what conditions the former implies the latte
