## Course description 


This course aims to introduce 21st century econometric analysis to business students. It provides tools to infer meaningful information from data using descriptive and regression analyses. Causal inference and study design will be at the center of the econometrics analysis class.  

At the end of the semester, I expect you to be familiar with **R** and **RStudio** interface, basic data manipulation, obtaining and interpreting sample statistics, conduct meaningful regression analysis and prediction. Importantly, I expect you to have a clear understanding of the distinction between correlation and causation, and in what conditions the former implies the latter. 

### Knowledge and Skills

* Compute and interpret the descriptive statistics of a sample.
* Understand the statistical uncertainty, construct and interpret the confidence intervals.
* Conduct hypothesis testing, interpret the test statistic and the results of a statistical test. 
* Construct a multivariate regression model, empirically estimate the model and interpret the results.
* In depth understanding of the randomized controlled trials and the  causal inference. 
* Choose and modify the functional form of a relationship between the output and the input variables. 

### Perspectives

* Learn how to conduct a regression analysis, understands its limitation in inferring a causal relationship, generalizing its results, and power in prediction an outcome that is unknown to the researcher.

* Understand the causal research design and its basic implementations. 

* Understand the regression diagnostics to choose the most appropriate definition of predictors, outcome, and functional form.
